## ðŸŒ± Your First Contribution

New to open source? Don't worry! Here's how to make your first contribution:

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `beginner friendly`
2. **Ask Questions**: If you're uncertain about anything, ask! We're here to help
3. **Start Small**: Begin with small changes to get familiar with the process

Not sure where to start? Here are some options:

## ðŸ’» Setting Up Your Development Environment

Let's get your development environment ready:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later, for AI service)
- Text editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the [repository page](https://github.com/marvelai-org/PresentationGenerator).

   ![Fork button example](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PresentationGenerator.git
   cd PresentationGenerator
   ```

3. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/marvelai-org/PresentationGenerator.git
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your own values (see the README for more details).

6. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

7. **Set up the AI Service** (if working on AI features)

   ```bash
   cd ai-services
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

   The AI service should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## ðŸ”„ Making Changes

Here's how to make changes to the codebase:

1. **Create a Branch**

   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

   Use a descriptive branch name following our conventions (see [Git Workflow](#-git-workflow)).

2. **Make Your Changes**

   Edit the code using your text editor.

3. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Also ensure the application still works as expected by running it locally.

4. **Format Your Code**

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

5. **Run Linting**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   Fix any linting errors that appear.

6. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

   Follow our commit message guidelines (see [Git Workflow](#-git-workflow)).

## ðŸ“¤ Pull Requests

1. **Push Your Branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request" next to your branch.

   ![Compare & pull request button](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-start-review-button.png)

3. **Fill Out the Pull Request Template**

   Provide a clear description of what your changes do and why they should be included.

## ï¿½ï¿½ Coding Conventions

We follow specific coding conventions to keep our codebase consistent:

### General Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the principle of "one function, one responsibility"
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Include TypeScript types for all functions and variables
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
- Format code with Prettier
- Follow ESLint rules

#### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- For complex components, consider using component-specific CSS modules
- Follow a mobile-first approach for responsive design

#### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Avoid large component files (aim for under 300 lines)
- Split complex components into smaller sub-components
- Use proper prop types/interfaces

#### Python (AI Service)

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints
- Document functions and classes with docstrings
- Use `async/await` for FastAPI endpoints

## ðŸŒ¿ Git Workflow

We follow a simple Git workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: The `main` branch contains the stable version of the code
2. **Development Branch**: The `development` branch is used for integration testing
3. **Feature Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
4. **Pull Requests**: Submit PRs to merge your changes into the development branch

### Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages in the imperative present tense:

```
feat: add dark mode toggle
fix: correct login button display on mobile
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for user authentication
```

Types include:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names with the following prefixes:

- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - For bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - For critical fixes that need immediate attention
- `docs/documentation-update` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - For code refactoring
- `release/version-number` - For release branches

Examples:

- `feature/slide-transitions`
- `bugfix/image-upload-error`
- `docs/api-documentation`

## ðŸ’¬ Communication

Have questions or need help? Here's how to get in touch:

- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Join the GitHub Discussions for general questions (coming soon)
- **Community Chat**: Join our community chat (coming soon)
