# API Security

This document outlines the security practices and policies implemented in the AI Backend service.

## Security Principles

The AI Backend service follows these core security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers
2. **Least Privilege**: Services operate with minimal required permissions
3. **Zero Trust**: All requests verified regardless of origin
4. **Security by Design**: Security integrated from initial architecture
5. **Continuous Verification**: Regular testing and monitoring

## TLS Configuration

All API communications use Transport Layer Security (TLS) with the following requirements:

- **Minimum TLS Version**: TLS 1.3 (TLS 1.2 supported but deprecated)
- **Cipher Suites**: Only modern AEAD ciphers allowed (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- **Certificate Requirements**: 
  - RSA-4096 or ECC P-256/P-384 keys
  - SHA-256 or stronger signatures
  - 90-day maximum validity
- **HSTS**: Strict-Transport-Security header with 1-year duration

## API Endpoint Security

### Input Validation

- All request parameters validated against OpenAPI schema definitions
- Strict type checking enforced
- Size limits on all request fields
- Validation implemented at API gateway and application levels

### Output Encoding

- All response data properly encoded to prevent injection attacks
- Content-Type headers strictly enforced
- Unicode normalization applied to text outputs

### CORS Policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured with:

- Explicit whitelisting of allowed origins
- Credentials mode restricted to trusted origins
- Preflight caching limited to 1 hour
- Only necessary HTTP methods exposed

Example CORS headers:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-origin.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-API-Key
Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
```

## Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection

- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: For granular rate limiting
- **Global Rate Limits**: IP-based limits to prevent abuse
- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Stricter limits on resource-intensive endpoints
- **Graduated Response**: Increasing delays for repeated violations
- **Automatic Blocking**: Temporary blocks for detected attack patterns

## Content Security

### Model Input Safety

- Input content screened for harmful prompts
- Jailbreak detection for LLM prompts
- Sanitization of user-provided URLs and file references

### Output Filtering

- Generated content checked for prohibited material
- Image generation monitored for safety violations
- Content warning headers added when appropriate

## Infrastructure Security

### Deployment Security

- Immutable infrastructure with containerization
- Regular security patching (within 72 hours for critical vulnerabilities)
- Image scanning before deployment
- Container runtime protection with least privilege

### Network Security

- Internal services not exposed to public internet
- Network segmentation between components
- Traffic filtering at multiple levels
- Encrypted inter-service communication

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with threat feeds
- **Incident Response Plan**: Documented procedures for security incidents
- **Recovery Targets**: RPO and RTO defined for all components

## Compliance

The AI Backend service is compliant with:

- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- CCPA/CPRA
- ISO 27001
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Security Testing

- **Automated Scanning**: Daily vulnerability scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly by independent security firms
- **Dependency Analysis**: Weekly scanning of dependencies
- **Fuzzing**: Continuous fuzzing of API endpoints
- **Red Team Exercises**: Annual comprehensive assessment

## Reporting Security Issues

Security vulnerabilities should be reported to:

- Email: security@example.com
- HackerOne program: https://hackerone.com/example

We follow a responsible disclosure process with a 90-day disclosure timeline.
