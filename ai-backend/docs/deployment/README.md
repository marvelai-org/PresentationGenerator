# Deployment Documentation

This section contains documentation on how to deploy the AI Backend service in various environments.

## Contents

- [Docker Deployment](./index.md#docker-deployment) - Docker-based deployment
- Cloud Providers:
  - [AWS](./cloud-providers/aws.md) - Deployment on AWS
  - [GCP](./cloud-providers/gcp.md) - Deployment on Google Cloud Platform
  - [Azure](./cloud-providers/azure.md) - Deployment on Microsoft Azure

## Deployment Options

The AI Backend service can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Docker** - The simplest deployment method, using the provided Dockerfile
2. **Cloud Providers** - Deployment on major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
3. **Kubernetes** - For scalable, orchestrated deployments

## Environment Configuration

All deployment methods require proper configuration of environment variables:

- API configuration (host, port, etc.)
- External service API keys (OpenRouter, Together.ai, etc.)
- Storage configuration (Supabase)
- CORS settings

Refer to the [Environment Variables](./index.md#environment-variable-management) section for details.

## Production Best Practices

When deploying to production, follow these best practices:

1. **Security**:
   - Use secret management services for API keys
   - Set up proper CORS restrictions
   - Disable debug mode

2. **Scalability**:
   - Configure auto-scaling based on load
   - Use horizontal scaling for high-traffic scenarios
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up health checks
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track error rates and resource usage

4. **Reliability**:
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Set up restart policies for failed containers
   - Use load balancing for high availability
