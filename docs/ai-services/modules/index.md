# AI Service Modules

This section provides detailed documentation for each of the AI modules used in the Presentation Generator service.

## Overview

The AI Services component is designed with a modular architecture, where each specialized task is handled by a dedicated module. This approach allows for:

- Independent development and testing of each module
- Flexibility to swap or upgrade individual components
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Easier maintenance and debugging

## Available Modules

### [Outline Generator](./outline-generator.md)

The Outline Generator module creates structured presentation outlines from topics. It analyzes a given topic and produces an organized sequence of slide titles that form a coherent presentation structure.

**Key features:**
- Topic analysis and structure formation
- Customizable number of slides
- Adaptable to different instructional levels
- Multi-language support

### [Slide Generator](./slide-generator.md)

The Slide Generator module transforms outline titles into comprehensive slide content. It takes each title from the outline and generates detailed, informative content appropriate for presentation slides.

**Key features:**
- Content generation with bullet points
- Speaker notes generation
- Complexity adaptation based on instructional level
- Context awareness across slides

### [Image Generator](./image-generator.md)

The Image Generator module creates visual elements for each slide based on its content. It analyzes the slide's title and content to produce relevant, high-quality images.

**Key features:**
- Content-aware image generation
- Integration with multiple image generation APIs
- Storage management with Supabase
- Image optimization for presentations

## Module Architecture

Each module follows a consistent architecture with the following components:

1. **Core**: The main processing logic and function definitions
2. **Tools**: Helper classes and utilities specific to the module
3. **API Integration**: Interfaces for external AI services
4. **Types**: Type definitions and schemas

## Common Patterns

All modules share some common design patterns:

- **Input Validation**: Using Pydantic models for request validation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with detailed messages
- **Logging**: Standardized logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration

## Extending Modules

To extend or customize the modules, see the respective documentation for each module. In general, you'll need to:

1. Understand the module's core functionality
2. Identify where your changes fit in the architecture
3. Follow the established patterns for that module
4. Add tests for your changes
